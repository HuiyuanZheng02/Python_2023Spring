  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived,                                             
with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts,         
as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the       
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts
upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--
`I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, `and hand round the                          
refreshments!'

  But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything                       
about her, to pass away the time.
